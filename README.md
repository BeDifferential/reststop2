## reststop2


---

**This package is deprecated.** I will fix bugs, but will neither add new
features nor ensure future Meteor compatibility. Everything that this package is
capable of can now be accomplished using
[`iron-router`](https://atmospherejs.com/iron/router) server-side routes and
core Meteor packages (for example `accounts-password`).

In fact, some folks seem to have done just that with this [`restivus`][restivus]
package. It shares all the features of `reststop2`, with a similar API and
planned support for Meteor 0.9.0+. Check it out!

Thanks for using `reststop2`.

RESTstop makes it easy to serve RESTful APIs from Meteor.
