## reststop2


---

**This package is deprecated.** I will fix bugs, but will neither add new
features nor ensure future Meteor compatibility. Everything that this package is
capable of can now be accomplished using
[`iron-router`](https://atmospherejs.com/iron/router) server-side routes and
core Meteor packages (for example `accounts-password`). Thanks for using
`reststop2`.

RESTstop makes it easy to serve RESTful APIs from Meteor.
